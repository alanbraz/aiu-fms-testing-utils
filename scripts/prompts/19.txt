In the heart of the ancient forest, there lived a creature known as Stalwart. Unlike any other beast, Stalwart was a massive stone gargoyle with an intricate design of vines and leaves etched into his form. His eyes were crafted from gleaming obsidian, reflecting the moonlight with a chilling brilliance.

Stalwart was not just any decorative element; he was the guardian of the forest's magic.
